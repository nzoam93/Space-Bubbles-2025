Creating game like Bubble Trouble

[Live Link](https://nzoam93.github.io/Space-Bubbles/)


Background:
This game is similar to the game "Bubble Trouble" that I used to play during childhood. You are in charage of a character who is stuck in a land of bubbles. The purpose of the game is to pop all of the bubbles before any of them hit your character. If a bubble hits you, then you lose a life. You pop the bubbles by shooting out a spike that will pop the bubble if it connects. The bubbles start off large and break into smaller bubbles when they are popped. Eventually, they reach the smallest size bubble and when you pop those, the bubble disappears and can no longer hurt you. Once you pop all the bubbles, you clear the level.

Instructions:
1. Your goal is to stay alive as long as possible, and pop as many bubbles as possible.
2. Avoid the bubbles. Each time you get hit, you lose a life.
3. If you don't finish the level in time, you lose the game!
4. Move the character by pressing the left and right arrow keys
5. Shoot a spike by pressing spacebar
6. Note that you can get bonuses by popping big bubbles!
7. Each time that you get hit by a bubble, you have 1.5 seconds of immunity from being hit again.


Functionality & MVPs: Users will be able to:
1. Move their character left and right along the bottom of the screen by using their arrow keys
2. Pop the bubbles by shooting out a spike
3. Clear the level by popping all of the bubbles
4. Collect coins that add to your total score
5. Advance from one level to the next by clearing the level of all the bubbles


In addition, this project will include:
1. Instructions
2. README
3. The ability to collect coins
4. The ability to use a shield that will protect you from falling bubbles

Technologies, Libraries, APIs:
1. Canvas API

Implementation Timeline:
- Friday Afternoon & Weekend: get a basic framework of the game to appear on the screen. Get the character to move around
- Monday: get the bubbles to move around. Introduce collision detection of the bubbles and the character
- Tuesday: introduce the ability for the character to shoot and pop bubbles. Have them pop into smaller bubbles
- Wednesday: Introduce multiple levels. Include introduction/instruction page
- Thursday morning: clean up everything. Make the CSS as sharp as possible.

Future To-Dos:
1. Implement 2-player mode
2. Add more characters / sprites
3. Add animation on the homescreen of the character jumping around
